Features of this calculator:

Input and Operators:
=====

[NUM1] ^ [NUM2] The ^ operator will with repeat NUM1 NUM2 times.

[NUM1] . [NUM2] The . operator will concatenate the NUM1 and NUM2.

([NUM1].[NUM2])^[NUM3] Parenthesis will execute with order of operations

Does not support any other operators at this time




Features
=====

Allows for multiple operators to perform at once. Will check for order of
operations.



Limitations
=====

This version of the program does not allow for the interpreter to give an answer
for an input length of greater than 11. I think this is because of the limit of
long ints because when using int, the limitation was only 8 digits.



Testing
=====
